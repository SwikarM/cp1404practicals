# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Books to Read

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _Swikar Mainali_

## Program Features

- Displays a welcome message with your name.  
- Loads a list of books from a CSV file at the start.  
- Presents a menu for the user to:
  - L – List all books, neatly aligned with unread ones marked by `*`
  - A – Add a new book (with error checking for blank or invalid inputs)
  - M – Mark a selected unread book as completed
  - Q – Quit the program, saving all changes back to the CSV file  
- Handles invalid menu options and ensures data integrity.
- Provides summary information on unread books.


1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

It took me around 4 to 5 hours to fully understand the requirements, implement the program, test it with different inputs,
and polish the formatting and validation.


2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

For Assignment 2, I plan to focus more on incremental development, testing each function as I go instead of building
large sections at once. I’ll also use consistent version control commits and write more descriptive comments for
readability and maintainability.
