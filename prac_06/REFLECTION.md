# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I've started reading the entire practical question thoroughly before starting to code, 
which has helped me understand the requirements better and avoid missing key details. I've also 
begun using time estimates more consistently, which helps with planning and time management.


## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to improve my consistency in starting practicals earlier in the week rather than leaving them until the last minute.
I should also work on breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps before coding.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I'm maintaining good code organization and following Python style guidelines consistently. I'm also doing well at testing
my code thoroughly and ensuring it meets the specified requirements. 


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop underestimating how long debugging will take and allocate more time for it in my planning. I should change
my approach to reviewing lecture materials before attempting practicals to ensure I have the necessary foundational knowledge.
I also need to be more proactive about practicing concepts I find challenging outside of assigned work


## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I would suggest incorporating more small, low-stakes collaborative coding exercises where students can work together to 
solve problems. This would help build the teamwork skills essential in real-world development while providing opportunities 
to learn from peers. For the degree overall, more emphasis on real-world project workflows and version control practices 
from earlier stages would be beneficial.
