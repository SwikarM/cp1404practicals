## Clean Code Lessons Learned

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function/class should have one clear responsibility, making code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Meaningful Naming:** Using descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes improves readability and reduces the need for excessive comments.
- **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoiding code duplication through functions and proper program structure makes code more maintainable and less error-prone.
